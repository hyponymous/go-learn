# go-learn: A Go Tutorial

Go is played on a board of intersecting lines.

!!grid
{
    "dimensions": "19x19",
    "stars": [[3,3],[3,9],[3,15],[9,3],[9,9],[9,15],[15,3],[15,9],[15,15]]
}
!!

Most games of go are played on a 19 by 19 grid, though sometimes people play on a smaller board for a quicker game:

!!grid
{
    "dimensions": "9x9",
    "cellSize": "30",
    "stars": [[2,2],[2,6],[4,4],[6,2],[6,6]]
}
!!
